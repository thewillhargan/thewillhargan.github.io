      <p>Vex Robageotics Competition Team #8984</p>
      <p>This season kicked off for us at the Ocenia Championships held in Canberra, Australia at the end of August. After not doing particularly well in the round robin qualification matches early on in the event we partnered with a strong team for the finals and playing to the different strengths of both of our robots we managed to secure the title of Ocenia Champions. Having only had the robot for 6 weeks this was a great achievement for us.</p>
      <p>Being based in Regional NSW, Goulburn we do not often get the chance to see other robots or test our robot on a field. When we arrived in Melbourne for the National Championships at the end of November we started to discover some unforseen problems with the robot. We competed strongly in the round robin qualifiers this time and then managed to progress to the grand finals where we placed second for the field aspect of the event. At the end award ceremony we were awarded the Excellence Award which is the highest honour available at a VRC event. This qualified us to compete at the World Championships at the Louisville Exposition Centre, Kentucky in April 2015</p>
      <p>The team is now seeking sponsorship to assist in paying for uniforms, promotional media and flights as well as to subsidise accommodation and food costs whilst overseas. If you are interested in sponsoring the team please consider donating at our indiegogo campaign or alternatively get in touch the team using the details found in the contact us page.</p>
